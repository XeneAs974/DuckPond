# Duck Pond Model


### Code Requirements

The example code use Java librairy [version 14.0.1](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk14-downloads.html) or higher will work).

I also use eclipse as a graphical environment, [I recommend it](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).


### Description

The representation in java of duck pond model must contain several elements :
1) The pond will be represented as a body of water with rocks and water lilies nun.
2) Ducks are born, live and die in the pool. Water lilies grow back randomly in a pond.
3) Sound for the whistling  of the leading duck

Life Cycle :

When a duck is born (first a duckling), it will move in the pond; when it encounters water lilies, it will eat it, when it eats, the duck will grow out. If the duck does not eat (defined) after a certain period of time, it will lose weight, and if it continues to lose weight, it will eventually die. On the contrary, a duck that eats a lot will become bigger, bigger and bigger, and eventually become a head duck. In this case, the duck will change color. A big duck is the only little whistling duck, and the other duck is lined up behind him.
